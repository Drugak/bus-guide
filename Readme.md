When nodejs is installed, itâ€™s possible to install the grunt command line interface via npm:

```
$:> npm uninstall -g grunt
// remove previous global installation of grunt

$:> npm install -g grunt-cli
// install grunt-cli
```



2. Install project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Minify/uglify/etc

```
grunt
